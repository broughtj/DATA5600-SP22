# Basic Terminology


## The Cast and Crew 

* __Experiment:__ a repeatable procedure with well-defined possible outcomes


* __Sample space:__ the set of all possible outcomes. This is often denoted by $\Omega$ or $S$.


* __Event:__ a subset of the sample space


* __Probability (mass) function (PMF):__ a function giving the probability for each outcomes


## Later Concepts

* __Probability density:__ a continuous distribution of probabilities


* __Random variable:__ a random numerical outcome (an outcome about whose value we are a priori uncertain)


## Simple Examples

__Example 1: Tossing a Fair Coin__

\vspace{5mm}

* [Experiment](): toss the coin, report if it lands heads or tails

* [Sample space](): $\Omega = \{H, T\}$

* [PMF](): $P(H) = 0.5$ \quad and \quad $P(T) = 0.5$

\vspace{8mm}

__Example 2: Toss a Fair Coin 3 Times__

\vspace{5mm}

* [Experiment](): toss the coin 3 times, list the results.

* [Sample space](): $\Omega = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}$

* [PMF](): Each outcome is equally likely with probability $1/8$.


## The PMF as a Table

| Outcomes    | HHH | HHT | HTH | HTT | THH | THT | TTH | TTT |
|:------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Probability | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 | 1/8 |
