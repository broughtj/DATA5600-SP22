### A Brief Review of Set Theory & Notation {-}

We will use capital letters such as $A, B, C$ to denote sets of points. If the elements in a set are $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$ we will write

\vspace{5mm}

$$
A = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\}
$$

\vspace{5mm}

Let $S$ be the set of all elements under consideration, in other words $S$ is the universal set. 

\vspace{5mm}

Take two sets $A$ and $B$. $A$ is a subset of $B$, or $A$ is contained in $B$, denoted

\vspace{5mm}

$$
A \subset B
$$

\vspace{5mm}

if every element of $A$ is also in $B$.

\vspace{5mm}

The null set, or empty set, denoted by $\varnothing$, is the set containing no points. Thus $\varnothing$. Thus $\varnothing$ is a subset of every set. 

\newpage

We can visualize sets with Venn diagrams.

\vspace{5mm}

```{r venn-contains, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A contained in B", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Book/images", "venn_contains.png"))
```

\vspace{10mm}

Consider now two arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$. The __union__ of $A$ and $B$, denoted

\vspace{5mm}

$$
A \cup B
$$

\vspace{5mm}

is the set of points in $A$ or $B$ or both. That is, the union of $A$ and $B$ contains all points in at least one of the sets. 

\vspace{5mm}

```{r venn-union, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A union B", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Book/images", "venn_union.png"))
```

The key word is "or" (meaning $A$ or $B$ or both)

\pagebreak

The __intersection__ of $A$ and $B$, denoted by

\vspace{5mm}

$$
A \cap B
$$

\vspace{5mm}

is the set of all points in both $A$ and $B$. 

\vspace{5mm}

```{r venn-intersect, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A intersect B", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Book/images", "venn_intersect.png"))
```

\vspace{5mm}


\vspace{5mm}

If $A$ is a subset of $S$, then the __complement__ of $A$, denoted b $\bar{A}$, is the set of all points that are in $S$, but not in $A$.

\vspace{5mm}

Venn diagram for $\bar{A}$

\vspace{5mm}

Note that $A \cup \bar{A} = S$

\vspace{5mm}

```{r venn-complement, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A complement", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Book/images", "venn_complement.png"))
```

\vspace{5mm}

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be mutually exclusive or __disjoint__ if $A \cap B = \varnothing$. That is, mutually exclusive set have no points in common. 

\vspace{5mm}

```{r venn-disjoint, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "A and B disjoint", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Book/images", "venn_disjoint.png"))
```

Consider the example of tossing a coin.

\vspace{5mm}

* Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

* Let $A = \{1, 2 \}$, $B = \{1, 3\}$, $C = \{2, 4, 6\}$

\vspace{5mm}

Then 

* $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\}$

* $A \cap B = \{1\}$

* $\bar{A} = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$

* Note: $B$ and $C$ are disjoint but $A$ and $C$ are not

Conditional probability in set Notation

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

\vspace{8mm}

Note that

$$
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$

\vspace{5mm}

Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \cap B) &= P(B|A)P(A) \\
& \\
P(A \cap B) &= P(A|B)P(B) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

\vspace{5mm}

From this, it follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A|B)P(B) &= P(B|A)P(A) \\
& \\
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{aligned}
$$

\vspace{5mm}

This is __Bayes' Rule__!
